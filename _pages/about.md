I am an associate professor in Statistics at the Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods at the [University of Milan (Statale)](https://eng.demm.unimi.it/ecm/home) and a Senior Researcher at [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM)](https://www.feem.it/en/).

From November 2024, I serve as Associate Editor for [Annals of Applied Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-applied-statistics/)

My research interests span across Econometrics and Statistics such as:
* Bayesian methods applied to time series models and to graph/network theory;
* Bayesian nonparametric techniques;
* Covariance matrix estimation;
* Forecasting techniques for novel datasets related to the energy transition.

I am one of the scientific organizers of the [Milan Time Series Seminars (MiTSS)](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/mitss/home-page) among University of Milan (Statale), University of Milan-Bicocca, Bocconi University, Polytechnique of Milan, FEEM, Catholic University of Milan.
