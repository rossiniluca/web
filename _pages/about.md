I am a tenure-track assistant professor in Statistics at the [Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods](https://eng.demm.unimi.it/ecm/home) at the University of Milan (Statale) and a Researcher at [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM)](https://www.feem.it/en/).
My research interests span across Econometrics and Statistics. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian methods applied to time series models and to graph/network theory; and I am also currently working on novel Bayesian nonparametric techniques and on covariance matrix estimation.
