I am a tenure-track assistant professor in Statistics at the Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods at the [University of Milan (Statale)](https://eng.demm.unimi.it/ecm/home) and a Researcher at [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM)](https://www.feem.it/en/).
My research interests span across Econometrics and Statistics. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian methods applied to time series models and to graph/network theory; I am also working on novel Bayesian nonparametric techniques and covariance matrix estimation. I am working on forecasting techniques for novel datasets related to the energy transition.

I am a co-principal investigator and head of the local unit of the project [*“Modelling Non-standard data and Extremes in Multivariate Environmental Time series (MNEMET)”*](https://rossiniluca.github.io/Mnemet/)(grant 20223CEZSR) and of the project [*"Mapping and Pricing of Methane Emissions from the European Electricity Sector (MAP-of-MeLEES)"*](https://rossiniluca.github.io/MAP-of-MeLEES/)(grant P2022H483A) funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the PRIN.

I am one of the scientific organizers of the new [Milan Time Series Seminars (MiTSS)](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/mitss/home-page), which is a seminar series among University of Milan (Statale), University of Milan-Bicocca, Bocconi University, Polytechnique of Milan, FEEM, Catholic University of Milan.
